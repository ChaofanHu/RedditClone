# Simple Reddit Clone

This is a simplified version of Reddit, built with Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The frontend can be run with `npm install` and `npm start`, and the backend can be compiled and run using Java 17.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- Java 17
- Maven (for managing Spring Boot dependencies)

## Getting Started

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `angular-frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd angular-frontend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend application:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `springboot-backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd springboot-backend
    ```

2. Ensure you are using Java 17. You can check your Java version with:
    ```sh
    java -version
    ```
